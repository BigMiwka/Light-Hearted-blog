The tests you may have to diagnose heart failure include:

1. blood tests – to check whether there's anything in your blood that might indicate heart failure or another illness
2. electrocardiogram (ECG) – this records the electrical activity of your heart to check for problems
3. echocardiogram – a type of ultrasound scan where sound waves are used to examine your heart
4. breathing tests – you may be asked to blow into a tube to check whether a lung problem is contributing to your breathlessness; common tests include spirometry and a peak flow test
5. chest X-ray – to check whether your heart's bigger than it should be, whether there's fluid in your lungs (a sign of heart failure), or whether a lung condition could be causing your symptoms
