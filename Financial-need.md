According to NHS England, hospital waiting lists for vital heart care are continuing to grow.

Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, our Associate Medical Director and Consultant Cardiologist, said: 

â€œThere is also another bigger, hidden backlog of people who are not even on the waiting list yet, because vital heart disease diagnoses are being delayed. This continued disruption puts lives at risk, which is all the more tragic because effective heart treatments exist."
