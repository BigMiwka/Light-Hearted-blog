# Financial Need for Light-Hearted

## Echocardiogram backlogs
According to NHS England, hospital waiting lists for vital heart care are continuing to grow.

Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, our Associate Medical Director and Consultant Cardiologist, said: 

“There is also another bigger, hidden backlog of people who are not even on the waiting list yet, because vital heart disease diagnoses are being delayed. This continued disruption puts lives at risk, which is all the more tragic because effective heart treatments exist."

Almost 100,000 people with serious heart problems, including some “living on borrowed time”, are enduring long waits for potentially life-saving NHS care because hospitals are so busy. They are waiting for procedures such as having a stent or balloon inserted to reopen a blocked artery, a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator fitted, or open heart surgery, including bypasses or valve replacement operations. Others urgently need to have an echocardiogram, CT or MRI scan to help doctors decide on treatment.

Figures showed that in December 2021, there were more than 80,000 people that had to wait more than 6 weeks for a heart ultrasound. In January 2022, compared to January 2020, there were 48% more patients were waiting more than 6 weeks for an echocardiogram. 


Light-Hearted's need: half of these echos scans end up being normal. By having Light-Hearted at primary care allows to streamline this long waitlist and avoid having unnecessary normal scans.

## Undiagnosed Valvular Heart Diseases

Valvular Heart Diseases are more prevalent in more deprived socioeconomic groups (even in a high-income country such as the UK) places VHD among the group of diseases that disproportionately affects the poor. 

Around 1.5m people in the UK aged 65 or over are thought to have heart valve disease, including aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Estimates suggest this will double by 2046 and rise to 3.3m in 2056. This is due to an ageing population.

Timely treatment is important because the risk of dying from valve disease is greater the longer the patient lives with it. It can also become severe and cause heart failure.

Treatment either involves surgery to repair or replace the faulty valve, or a procedure such as a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to insert a new valve without removing the damaged one.

One way GPs can improve detection rates in their area is to auscultate – listen to the heart using a stethoscope – when patients present with symptoms typical of heart valve disease such as breathlessness and chest pain.


A recent study by Moore et al. (2016) estimated the incremental expenditures related to VHD at $23.4 with a range as high as $36.8 billion in 2011.

Surgical intervention with the newer technologies for valve repair and replacement offer the potential for restorative treatment, improved quality of life and increased lifespan. However, many individuals are asymptomatic and undiagnosed. These individuals often present at a moderate-to-severe state, which limits treatment options. 

A potential policy option to address this is via a more rigorous effort around detection, possibly through a covered screening program for individuals at risk for VHDThe US government passed the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently Act, which mandated The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to cover a one-time ultrasound scan in men aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked beginning in 2007. The promotion and screening for AAA has been shown to improve clinical outcomes while being cost-effective. The clinical and economic benefits from AAA screening may translate to similar benefits for those at risk of VHD.
