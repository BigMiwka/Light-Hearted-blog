# Financial Need for Light-Hearted

## Echocardiogram backlogs
According to NHS England, hospital waiting lists for vital heart care are continuing to grow.

Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, our Associate Medical Director and Consultant Cardiologist, said: 

“There is also another bigger, hidden backlog of people who are not even on the waiting list yet, because vital heart disease diagnoses are being delayed. This continued disruption puts lives at risk, which is all the more tragic because effective heart treatments exist."

Almost 100,000 people with serious heart problems, including some “living on borrowed time”, are enduring long waits for potentially life-saving NHS care because hospitals are so busy. They are waiting for procedures such as having a stent or balloon inserted to reopen a blocked artery, a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator fitted, or open heart surgery, including bypasses or valve replacement operations. Others urgently need to have an echocardiogram, CT or MRI scan to help doctors decide on treatment.

Figures showed that in December 2021, there were more than 80,000 people that had to wait more than 6 weeks for a heart ultrasound. In January 2022, compared to January 2020, there were 48% more patients were waiting more than 6 weeks for an echocardiogram.
