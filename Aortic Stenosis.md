# Aortic Stenosis

## What it is
The aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart.


## Treatment
The treatment plan for your aortic stenosis depends on how severe your condition is.

If your case is mild or moderate, your doctor may decide to keep an eye on how you’re doing for a while. You’ll get regular checkups and echocardiograms. You may hear this called “watchful waiting,” and even if your stenosis is severe, your doctor may recommend it if you have no symptoms.

Your doctor will probably encourage you to make changes to improve your overall heart health. Those shifts might include:

1. Tweaking your diet to make it healthier
2. Working on weight loss, if needed
3. Quitting smoking
4. Managing your stress
5. Exercising, depending on your symptoms
6. Medications

No pill can cure or even improve your aortic stenosis. But there are some medications that may help you control your symptoms and lower the chance of having certain complications.

Among the medicines your doctor might prescribe are:
1. ACE inhibitors, which can open blood vessels more fully
2. Medicines that tame heart rhythm problems
3. Beta-blockers, which slow your heart rate
4. Diuretics (“water pills”), which lessen the amount of fluid in your body and ease stress on your heart

You and your doctor will probably also talk about whether you should take aspirin every day and whether you need to take statins, which are meds that lower your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. They have some benefits for your overall heart health but -- like all medications -- come with risks as well.

Procedures
If your aortic stenosis needs more aggressive treatment, you may have choices. Some procedures repair your faulty valve. Others replace it.
